To use the game we will need the following:

1. Extract the file from the zip.
Right click on the file "T-Rex-Game-master.zip" extract file

2. Once extracted, we will open the file and select the address bar of the browser (which is above)
and we will put in it "cmd"

In this window we will put "npm install"
A loading bar will have to appear and we will wait for the program to be installed
To know that the process finished, we had to have returned to our origin route (image looks like it would look like)

4. Then the only thing we will do is put "npm run dev"
This will cause and give us an ip address that we will have to copy and paste into our browser
As we will know what the ip is, it is normally called "http://localhost:8080/"
And ready.
